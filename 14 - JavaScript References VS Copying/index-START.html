    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    let players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    let team = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    const team2 = players.push(1);
    console.log(players, team2);

    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'heeee hawww';

    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      test: {
        a: 1
      }
    };

    let person2 = Object.assign({}, person)
    person2.age = 16

    let person3 = { ...person }
    person3.age = 10

    let person4 = person

    person4.test.a = 10

    person2.test.a = 12
    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    console.log(person3, person4)
    console.log(person2, person)


    //deep clone
    const person5 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person))

    person5.test.a = 3
